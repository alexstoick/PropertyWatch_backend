It currently starts at Trafalgar Square and runs east to join Fleet Street at Temple Bar, which marks the boundary of the City of London at this point, though its historical length has been longer than this.At the east end of the street are two old churches, St Mary-le-Strand and St Clement Danes which are now, owing to road-widening, situated on islands in the middle of the road. The length of road from St Mary\'s church eastwards up to St Clement\'s was widened in 1900 and subsumes the former Holywell Street which forked from the Strand and ran parallel with it to the north. The Strand marks the southern boundary of Covent Garden.Two tube stations were once named Strand: The former Piccadilly line Strand tube station, now called Aldwych but no longer in use, and the former \"Strand tube station\" on the Northern Line now part of Charing Cross tube station. \"Strand Bridge\" was also the name given to Waterloo Bridge during construction, it was renamed for its official opening on the second anniversary of the victory.Covent Garden is a district in London on the eastern fringes of the West End, between St. Martin\'s Lane and Drury Lane. It is associated with the former fruit and vegetable market in the central square, now a popular shopping and tourist site, and the Royal Opera House, which is also known as \"Covent Garden\". The district is divided by the main thoroughfare of Long Acre, north of which is given over to independent shops centred on Neal\'s Yard and Seven Dials, while the south contains the central square with its street performers and most of the elegant buildings, theatres and entertainment facilities, including the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, and the London Transport Museum.', 'http://www.zoopla.co.uk/to-rent/details/17253341?utm_source=v1:orWHECPMF0DT7Rn9Zex57mL0fRs8gbnb&utm_medium=api', 'http://li.zoocdn.com/5c889fa2ea7669433c9d93e60bcdd569300a6882_354_255.jpg', 51.50763, -0.125369, 5, 6, 3800, 'Luxurious and stunning 5 to 6 bedroom townhouse with 5 bathrooms and 3 ensuite dressing rooms quietly situated just off the Strand.

It currently starts at Trafalgar Square and runs east to join Fleet Street at Temple Bar, which marks the boundary of the City of London at this point, though its historical length has been longer than this.At the east end of the street are two old churches, St Mary-le-Strand and St Clement Danes which are now, owing to road-widening, situated on islands in the middle of the road. The length of road from St Mary\'s church eastwards up to St Clement\'s was widened in 1900 and subsumes the former Holywell Street which forked from the Strand and ran parallel with it to the north. The Strand marks the southern boundary of Covent Garden.Two tube stations were once named Strand: The former Piccadilly line Strand tube station, now called Aldwych but no longer in use, and the former \"Strand tube station\" on the Northern Line now part of Charing Cross tube station. \"Strand Bridge\" was also the name given to Waterloo Bridge during construction, it was renamed for its official opening on the second anniversary of the victory.Covent Garden is a district in London on the eastern fringes of the West End, between St. Martin\'s Lane and Drury Lane. It is associated with the former fruit and vegetable market in the central square, now a popular shopping and tourist site, and the Royal Opera House, which is also known as \"Covent Garden\". The district is divided by the main thoroughfare of Long Acre, north of which is given over to independent shops centred on Neal\'s Yard and Seven Dials, while the south contains the central square with its street performers and most of the elegant buildings, theatres and entertainment facilities, including the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, and the London Transport Museum.', 'http://www.zoopla.co.uk/to-rent/details/17253341?utm_source=v1:orWHECPMF0DT7Rn9Zex57mL0fRs8gbnb&utm_medium=api', 'http://li.zoocdn.com/5c889fa2ea7669433c9d93e60bcdd569300a6882_354_255.jpg', 51.50763, -0.125369, 5, 6, 3800, 'Luxurious and stunning 5 to 6 bedroom townhouse with 5 bathrooms and 3 ensuite dressing rooms quietly situated just off the Strand.

It currently starts at Trafalgar Square and runs east to join Fleet Street at Temple Bar, which marks the boundary of the City of London at this point, though its historical length has been longer than this.At the east end of the street are two old churches, St Mary-le-Strand and St Clement Danes which are now, owing to road-widening, situated on islands in the middle of the road. The length of road from St Mary\'s church eastwards up to St Clement\'s was widened in 1900 and subsumes the former Holywell Street which forked from the Strand and ran parallel with it to the north. The Strand marks the southern boundary of Covent Garden.Two tube stations were once named Strand: The former Piccadilly line Strand tube station, now called Aldwych but no longer in use, and the former \"Strand tube station\" on the Northern Line now part of Charing Cross tube station. \"Strand Bridge\" was also the name given to Waterloo Bridge during construction, it was renamed for its official opening on the second anniversary of the victory.Covent Garden is a district in London on the eastern fringes of the West End, between St. Martin\'s Lane and Drury Lane. It is associated with the former fruit and vegetable market in the central square, now a popular shopping and tourist site, and the Royal Opera House, which is also known as \"Covent Garden\". The district is divided by the main thoroughfare of Long Acre, north of which is given over to independent shops centred on Neal\'s Yard and Seven Dials, while the south contains the central square with its street performers and most of the elegant buildings, theatres and entertainment facilities, including the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, and the London Transport Museum.', 'http://www.zoopla.co.uk/to-rent/details/17253341?utm_source=v1:orWHECPMF0DT7Rn9Zex57mL0fRs8gbnb&utm_medium=api', 'http://li.zoocdn.com/5c889fa2ea7669433c9d93e60bcdd569300a6882_354_255.jpg', 51.50763, -0.125369, 5, 6, 3800, 'Luxurious and stunning 5 to 6 bedroom townhouse with 5 bathrooms and 3 ensuite dressing rooms quietly situated just off the Strand.

It currently starts at Trafalgar Square and runs east to join Fleet Street at Temple Bar, which marks the boundary of the City of London at this point, though its historical length has been longer than this.At the east end of the street are two old churches, St Mary-le-Strand and St Clement Danes which are now, owing to road-widening, situated on islands in the middle of the road. The length of road from St Mary\'s church eastwards up to St Clement\'s was widened in 1900 and subsumes the former Holywell Street which forked from the Strand and ran parallel with it to the north. The Strand marks the southern boundary of Covent Garden.Two tube stations were once named Strand: The former Piccadilly line Strand tube station, now called Aldwych but no longer in use, and the former \"Strand tube station\" on the Northern Line now part of Charing Cross tube station. \"Strand Bridge\" was also the name given to Waterloo Bridge during construction, it was renamed for its official opening on the second anniversary of the victory.Covent Garden is a district in London on the eastern fringes of the West End, between St. Martin\'s Lane and Drury Lane. It is associated with the former fruit and vegetable market in the central square, now a popular shopping and tourist site, and the Royal Opera House, which is also known as \"Covent Garden\". The district is divided by the main thoroughfare of Long Acre, north of which is given over to independent shops centred on Neal\'s Yard and Seven Dials, while the south contains the central square with its street performers and most of the elegant buildings, theatres and entertainment facilities, including the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, and the London Transport Museum.', 'http://www.zoopla.co.uk/to-rent/details/17253341?utm_source=v1:orWHECPMF0DT7Rn9Zex57mL0fRs8gbnb&utm_medium=api', 'http://li.zoocdn.com/5c889fa2ea7669433c9d93e60bcdd569300a6882_354_255.jpg', 51.50763, -0.125369, 5, 6, 3800, 'Luxurious and stunning 5 to 6 bedroom townhouse with 5 bathrooms and 3 ensuite dressing rooms quietly situated just off the Strand.
